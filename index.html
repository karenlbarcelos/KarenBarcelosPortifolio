            <p>Hello! I'm Karen, a developer aiming to enhance my skills as a full-stack developer. I
                also have a great passion for cooking, and here I'd like to develop my new HTML, CSS, and JS skills
                while sharing my favorite and better recipes. The most important thing about me is... I'm trying to live
                my best life. Hope we have fun!</p>

            <h2>Fav Recipes</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>5 cups vegetable stock</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed</li>
                <li>3 small leeks, halved and thinly sliced</li>
                <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
                <li>1 cup carnaroli rice</li>
                <li>1 cup white wine</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>1/3 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks</li>
                <li>1 pinch kosher salt, plus more to taste</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons minced chives, for garnish</li><br>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <li>Place the stock on a low simmer in a stockpot and keep a ladle nearby. Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in
                    a deep, heavy saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until
                    translucent; do not let them brown. Add the leeks and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes, or
                    until the leeks have softened.
                    Stir the rice and toast for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pour in the wine and let it simmer until the liquid is absorbed, and continue scraping the pan so
                    that the rice doesn't stick. Season the rice with salt, then begin adding stock a ladle at a time,
                    stirring often, and allowing most of the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. The rice is
                    cooked once the grains are al dente, fully cooked but with a soft bite on the inside.</li>
                <li>Turn off the heat and vigorously beat in the butter and cheese with a wooden spoon to help it
                    emulsify with the rice. If you prefer not to do this on the stove, move the pan to a towel on the
                    counter. Whatever you do, don't hesitate. Really shake the pan back and forth with one hand while
                    stirring with the other.
                </li>
                <li>Add the whipped cream, then season with salt, only if needed. Continue stirring with abandon until
                    all the ingredients have been incorporated. Serve immediately, garnished with additional Parmesan
                    cheese and chives.
                </li>
