## Programming Delights
I've created this repository to showcase my knowledge as I dive into a full-stack course on the Codecademy website. I'll be sharing the process, and I hope you all can see my dedication.

## ðŸ‘© About me: 
My name is Karen, I'm 24 years old, and I am a software developer in the early stages of my career. I have almost 2 years of experience in the workforce, working as a trainee and consultant at a big four company. I've been involved in two projects from different areas, both in web development, which helped me gain knowledge in Java, Spring Boot, SQL (relational databases), Maven, Git, Agile methodology (Scrum), some task management tools, among other things. I recently returned from an exchange program and am actively seeking to re-enter the job market. I've made the decision to start a course with the goal of developing myself as a Full Stack developer, and I'm using the Codecademy platform.

## ðŸ“‘ Objective:
I've decided to unite two of my passions: cooking and coding. I love cooking for those I care about, and now as I'm learning more about front-end development, why not share it with you through a webpage?

## ðŸ“š Summary of each technology: (used to date)

#### HTML: 
(Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used to create and structure content on web pages. It provides a way to organize information and elements in a format understandable to web browsers. Using specific tags, HTML allows the definition of various elements such as text, images, links, tables, and forms, which are interpreted by browsers to render web pages. Essentially, HTML provides the foundational structure and semantics for the content of a web page, enabling the creation of interfaces and the presentation of information in a structured and accessible manner.

#### CSS:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style language used in conjunction with HTML to control the presentation and design of web pages. While HTML structures the content of the page, CSS determines how that content should be styled and formatted. With CSS, it's possible to apply colors, fonts, margins, positioning, and various other visual styles to HTML elements. Additionally, CSS enables the creation of responsive layouts, making pages adaptable to different devices and screen sizes. By separating content (HTML) from presentation (CSS), this language provides a more modular and flexible approach to web interface design.
