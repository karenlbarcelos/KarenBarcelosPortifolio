## Programming Delights
I've created this repository to showcase my knowledge as I dive into a full-stack course on the Codecademy website. I'll be sharing the process, and I hope you all can see my dedication.

## Goals
I've decided to unite two of my passions: cooking and coding. I love cooking for those I care about, and now as I'm learning more about front-end development, why not share it with you through a webpage?
