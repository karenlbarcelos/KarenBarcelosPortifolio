                <h2>Fav Recipes</h2>
                <p>5 cups vegetable stock<br>
                    2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more as needed<br>
                    3 small leeks, halved and thinly sliced<br>
                    1 shallot, minced<br>
                    1 cup carnaroli rice<br>
                    1 cup white wine<br>
                    2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>
                    1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese<br>
                    1/3 cup heavy cream, whipped to soft peaks<br>
                    1 pinch kosher salt, plus more to taste<br>
                    2 tablespoons minced chives, for garnish<br></p>
                <h3>Directions</h3>
                <div id="fav-recipes-dir">
                    <p>1. Place the stock on a low simmer in a stockpot and keep a ladle nearby. Heat 2 tablespoons
                        of
                        oil
                        in
                        a deep, heavy saut√© pan over medium heat. Add the shallot and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until
                        translucent; do not let them brown. Add the leeks and cook for an additional 3 to 5 minutes,
                        or
                        until the leeks have softened.<br><br>
                        2. Stir the rice and toast for 2 to 3 minutes.<br><br>
                        3. Pour in the wine and let it simmer until the liquid is absorbed, and continue scraping
                        the
                        pan so
                        that the rice doesn't stick. Season the rice with salt, then begin adding stock a ladle at a
                        time,
                        stirring often, and allowing most of the liquid to be absorbed before adding more. The rice
                        is
                        cooked once the grains are al dente, fully cooked but with a soft bite on the
                        inside.<br><br>
                        4. Turn off the heat and vigorously beat in the butter and cheese with a wooden spoon to
                        help it
                        emulsify with the rice. If you prefer not to do this on the stove, move the pan to a towel
                        on
                        the
                        counter. Whatever you do, don't hesitate. Really shake the pan back and forth with one hand
                        while
                        stirring with the other.<br><br>
                        5. Add the whipped cream, then season with salt, only if needed. Continue stirring with
                        abandon
                        until
                        all the ingredients have been incorporated. Serve immediately, garnished with additional
                        Parmesan
                        cheese and chives.</p>
